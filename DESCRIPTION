Title: Variance Stabilizing Transformations appropriate for RNA-Seq expression data
Description: Transform RNA-Seq count data so that variance due to biological noise plus
    its count-based nature is stable across genes with different average expression levels.
    This takes the form a a log transformation which is moderated for low counts.
    Transforming data in this way makes many statistical and machine learning techniques
    applicable.
