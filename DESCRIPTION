Title: Variance Stabilizing Transformations appropriate for RNA-Seq expression
    data
Description: Transform RNA-Seq count data so that variance due to biological
    noise plus its count-based nature is stable across genes with different
    average expression levels. This takes the form of a log transformation which is
    moderated for low counts. Transforming data in this way makes many statistical
    and machine learning techniques applicable. A Shiny report function showing
    diagnostic plots based on the transformed data is also provided.
