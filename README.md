# Varistran

Varistran is an R package providing a Variance Stabilizing Transformation appropriate for RNA-Seq data, and a variety of diagnostic plots based on such transformation.

Varistran is developed by Paul Harrison (paul.harrison@monash.edu, [@paulfharrisson](https://twitter.com/paulfharrison)) for the [Monash Bioinformatics platform](https://platforms.monash.edu/bioinformatics/).

## Install

Varistran is most easily installed from GitHub using devtools:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/varistran")
```

### Dependencies

By default, library size estimation is by TMM, implemented in edgeR from BioConductor. You will need to install this manually if you haven't already:

```
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("edgeR")
```

Varistran also uses various CRAN packages, which will be installed automatically using the `devtools::install_github` method above. Refer to the DESCRIPTION file for the full list of dependencies.

## Example usage

I intend to keep adding features to Varistran. Therefore, I recommend using its functions via `varistran::` rather than attaching its namespace with `library(varistran)`.

The examples below use the [Bottomly dataset](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/ExpressionSets/bottomly_eset.RData) available from [ReCount](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/).

```
library(Biobase)

download.file("http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/ExpressionSets/bottomly_eset.RData", 
              "bottomly_eset.RData")

load("bottomly_eset.RData")

counts <- exprs(bottomly.eset)

strain <- phenoData(bottomly.eset)$strain
experiment.number <- factor( phenoData(bottomly.eset)$experiment.number )
design <- model.matrix(~ strain + experiment.number)
```

Say you have a count matrix `counts` and a design matrix `design`. To perform a variance stabilizing transformation:

```
y <- varistran::vst(counts, design=design)
```

By default, Anscombe's variance stabilizing transformation for the negative binomial distribution is used. This behaves like log2 for large counts (log2 Counts-Per-Million if `cpm=T` is given).

An appropraite dispersion is estimated with the aid of the design matrix. If omitted, this defaults to a column of ones, for blind estimation of the dispersion. This might slightly over-estimate the dispersion. A third possibility is to estimate the dispersion with edgeR.

### Diagnostic plots

`plot_stability` allows assessment of how well the variance has been stabilized. Ideally this will produce a horizontal line, but counts below 5 will always show a drop off in variance.

```
varistran::plot_stability(y, counts, design=design)
```

`plot_biplot` provides a two-dimensional overview of your samples and genes using Principle Components Analysis (similar concept to `plotMDS` in limma):

```
varistran::plot_biplot(y)
```

`plot_heatmap` draws a heatmap.

```
varistran::plot_heatmap(y, n=50)
```

### Shiny report

Varistran's various diagnostic plots are also available as a Shiny app, which can be launched with:

```
varistran::shiny_report(y, counts)
```

If `y` is not given it is calculated with `varistran::vst(counts)`.

```
varistran::shiny_report(counts=counts)
```

## Test suite

Download the source code, and ensure that the Bioconductor packages in the "Suggests:" field of the DESCRIPTION file are installed. Then a suite of tests can be run with:

```
make test
```

Outputs are placed in a directory called `test_output`.
