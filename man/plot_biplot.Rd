Biplot of expression data
}
\description{
Produce a ggplot containing a biplot of expression data.
}
\usage{
plot_biplot(x, sample_labels = NULL, balance = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ 
      Matrix of expression levels, with features (eg genes) as rows and samples as columns.
  }
  \item{sample_labels}{
      Sample labels.
  }
  \item{balance}{
      Relative scaling of features and samples.
  }
}
\details{
Biplot based on the Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix x. The dimensions corresponding to the two largest singular values are shown.

Genes are shown in blue and samples in red.

The dot product of the gene and sample vectors from (0,0) approximates the difference from the average expression level of that gene in that sample.

Sample points (red) are scaled to have the same mean square in the two dimensions. Therefore the gene points (blue) may be somewhat stretched along dimension 1 if dimension 1 explains more of the variance than dimension 2.

}
\value{
A ggplot object.

This must be print()-ed to actually plot.
