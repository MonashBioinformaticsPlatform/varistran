\title{Biplot of expression data}
\usage{
plot_biplot(x, sample_labels = NULL, feature_labels = NULL,
  n_features = 20, balance = 0.25, text_size = 0.025)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix of expression levels, with features (eg genes) as rows and
samples as columns. For example, you could use the output of varistran::vst
here.}

\item{sample_labels}{Sample labels.}

\item{feature_labels}{Feature labels.}

\item{n_features}{Number of extreme features to label.}

\item{balance}{Relative scaling of features and samples.}

\item{text_size}{plot_biplot attempts to stop labels from overlapping.
Adjust this so that text just doesn't overlap. Set to zero to allow labels
to completely overlap.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.

This must be print()-ed to actually plot.
}
\description{
Produce a ggplot object containing a biplot of expression data.
}
\details{
Biplot based on the Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix x. The
dimensions corresponding to the two largest singular values are shown.

Genes are shown in blue and samples in red.

The dot product of the gene and sample vectors approximates the difference
from the average expression level of that gene in that sample.

Sample points (red) are scaled to have the same variance in the two
dimensions. Therefore the gene points (blue) may have greater variance along
dimension 1 if dimension 1 explains more of the variance than dimension 2.

# Assuming counts is a matrix of read counts.
y <- varistran::vst(counts)
print( varistran::plot_biplot(y) )
