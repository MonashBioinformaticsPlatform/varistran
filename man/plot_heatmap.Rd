\title{Plot a heatmap.}
\usage{
plot_heatmap(y, cluster_samples = FALSE, cluster_features = TRUE,
  sample_labels = NULL, feature_labels = NULL, baseline = NULL,
  baseline_label = "row\\nmean", scale_label = "difference from\\nrow mean",
  n = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A matrix of expression levels, such as a transformed counts matrix as produced by \code{varistran::vst}.}

\item{cluster_samples}{Should samples (columns) be clustered?}

\item{cluster_features}{Should features (rows) be clustered?}

\item{sample_labels}{Names for each sample. If not given and y has column names, these will be used instead.}

\item{feature_labels}{Names for each feature. If not given and y has row names, these will be used instead.}

\item{baseline}{Baseline level for each row, to be subtracted when drawing the heatmap colors. If omitted, the row mean will be used.}

\item{baseline_label}{Text description of what the baseline is.}

\item{scale_label}{Text description of what the heatmap colors represent (after baseline is subtracted).}

\item{n}{Show only this many rows. Rows are selected in order of greatest span of expression level.}
}
\value{
A grid grob. print()-ing this value will cause it to be displayed.

Additionally $info$row_order will contain row ordering and $info$col_order will contain column ordering.
}
\description{
Produces a heatmap as a grid grob.
}
\details{
This heatmap differs from other heatmaps in R in the method of clustering used:

1. The distances used are cosine distances (i.e. the magnitude of log fold changes is not important, only the pattern).

2. \code{hclust()} is used to produce a clustering, as normal.

3. Branches in the hierarchical clustering are flipped to minimize sharp changes between neighbours, using the seriation package's OLO (Optimal Leaf Ordering) method.

\examples{

# Generate some random data.
counts <- matrix(rnbinom(1000, size=1/0.01, mu=100), ncol=10)

y <- varistran::vst(counts, cpm=TRUE)
print( varistran::plot_heatmap(y, n=20) )
