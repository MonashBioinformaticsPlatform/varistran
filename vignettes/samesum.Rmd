This article puts `samesum_log2_norm()` and `samesum_log2_cpm()` through their paces.

## Example usage

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(varistran)
library(Matrix)
library(airway)

data("airway")
```

```{r}
x <- assay(airway, "counts")

lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x)

colSums(lnorm)
attr(lnorm,"sum")
attr(lnorm,"samples")
```

```{r fig.width=6,fig.height=8}
plot_heatmap(
  lnorm, 
  feature_labels=rowData(airway)$symbol, 
  n=50, baseline_to=0)
```

```{r fig.width=6,fig.height=8}
plot_biplot(lnorm, feature_labels=rowData(airway)$symbol)
```

## Filtering

Some analysis methods don't work well with features that are nearly all zero. In particular we suggest filtering before using limma. However samesum transformation works fine with very sparse data, so we suggest transforming your data before filtering it. This allows filtering to be applied fairly across samples with different scale values.

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(lnorm) >= 1
table(keep)
lnorm_filtered <- lnorm[keep,]
plot_stability(lnorm_filtered)
```

## You can provide a larger target scale for greater variance stabilization

The default target scale parameter is 2, which may produce noisy results for features with low abundance. This scale parameter can be increased.

```{r}
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x, scale=10)

colSums(lnorm)
attr(lnorm, "samples")

keep <- rowSums(lnorm) >= 1
table(keep)
lnorm_filtered <- lnorm[keep,]
plot_stability(lnorm_filtered)
```

## You can provide a target sum for consistent transformation across datasets

```{r}
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x, sum=1e5)

colSums(lnorm)
attr(lnorm, "samples")
```

## You can also produce log2 CPM values

This is quite similar to edgeR's `cpm` function with `log=TRUE`.

```{r}
lcpm <- samesum_log2_cpm(x)
```

Zeros will no longer be zero. This is fine, log transformation is meant to transform positive values to cover the whole real line. It is *convenient* sometimes to pick a log transformation with a pseudocount that transforms zeros to zero, but it is not *necessary*. 

You can check the value that zeros are transformed to.

```{r}
min(lcpm)
attr(lcpm, "zero")

mean(colSums(2^lcpm-2^attr(lcpm,"zero")))
```

Adjust your filtering appropriately.

```{r}
keep <- rowMeans(lcpm) >= attr(lcpm,"zero")+1
table(keep)
```

## Low library size samples produce a warning

Here I have downsampled the first sample to 1% of the original.

```{r}
set.seed(563)
x <- assay(airway, "counts")
x[,1] <- rbinom(nrow(x), x[,1], 0.01) 

lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x)
```

You can examine the samples attribute for more details.

```{r}
attr(lnorm,"samples")
```

Sample 1 is indeed an outlier now, and this is purely an artifact of the transformation:

```{r fig.width=6,fig.height=8}
plot_heatmap(lnorm, feature_labels=rowData(airway)$symbol, n=50, baseline_to=0)
```

Increasing the `scale` parameter removes the warning and fixes the problem. The cost is that we squash variability in genes with low expression levels. It's like we've reduced the "resolution" of the data.

```{r fig.width=6,fig.height=8}
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x, scale=200)

plot_heatmap(lnorm, feature_labels=rowData(airway)$symbol, n=50, baseline_to=0)
```

You will also get a warning if a sample is all zero.

```{r}
x[,1] <- 0 
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x)
```

Or sometimes a sample has very low library size or complexity, and the scale underflows to zero.

```{r}
x[1,1] <- 1
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x)
```

## Sparse matrices can be used

`samesum_log2_norm` transforms zeros to zeros, so the matrix remains sparse.

```{r}
x <- Matrix( assay(airway, "counts") )
lnorm <- samesum_log2_norm(x)
class(lnorm)
```
